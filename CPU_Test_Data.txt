Notes:
Appears the majority of the 15.5 million allocations occurs during preallocation as when any case retested directly after first test, the number of allocations drops significantly
Potential area for improvement with the GPU as a result
No significant difference between LUT solution and boundary_info struct solution in terms of performance
boundary_info struct solution likely to be more scalable in the future based on memory load - literature needed
