*Guidelines and practical information for contributing to XCALibre.jl*

## Introduction
---

From its humble beginning as a 1D diffusion example code to explore the features (and claim of speed ðŸ˜„) of the Julia programming language, XCALibre.jl was meant to be shared and used to help students understand the Finite Volume Method and as an entry point to explore the implementation details underpinning CFD. As the code base has grown, this original motivation has remained. However, XCALibre.jl is now a more complete CFD software stack which can be used by both researchers and students to test out new ideas, even on complex geometry with acceptable performance. Likewise, XCALibre.jl will hopefully continue to grow and offer more functionality as it has been the case for since 2022. In the sharing spirit of open-source software we also welcome code contributions, and we hope to make this process as simple as possible. In this page we provide key information for those users who want to customise, refine, improve, or extend XCALibre.jl. 

In time, our ambition is to document the internal API completely, however, this will be an ongoing process. However, since we use a modular approach and the current functionality covers a good portion of the CFD stack,
