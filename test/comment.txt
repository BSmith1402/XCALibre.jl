For laplace solver validation, I used a case where:
    - we have a square domain
    - left and bottom are Dirichlet at T=0 and T=1 accordingly
    - top and right are zeroGradient

The expected behaviour is diagonal line from bottom left to top right 
                with smooth temperature increase/decrease towards Dirichlet boundaries


This is exactly the behaviour we get when using laplace solver in Steady and Transient state + LaplaceEnergy
(check 'testing_laplace.png', 'grid_laplace.png')



However when CryogenicConduction model is turned on (only for Transient), 
                it recomputes cp and rho at every iteration based on the precoded formula

The article that I referred to when implementing it said that it shows great accuracy for 4-300K

When trying to run this same case with this advanced model, it crashes as expected.

However, after changing Dirichlet values it runs well

The results are different from the simple model! 
(look at 'CryoEnergy_high_temp.png', 'CryoEnergy_low_temp.png')

Apparently, when running simulation at temperatures about 300K, the diagonal line is
                almost perfectly diagonal/linear as in the default energy model

But at lower temperatures, when k and cp apparently start to vary more, the line
                becomes increasingly non-linear

This sounds like a more realistic result, so I assume it works just as expected...
